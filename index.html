I started my adventure in primary school with a programing site called scratch, it was an introduction to programming. When i got into 
  secondary school i went back to doing scratch but i went further then i had before. After scratch we moved onto improving our typing 
  speed and learnt ho to use computers better. In third year we started to learn python it was a lot different to using blocks now we 
  had to learn words and symbols, we were also using raspberry pies and microbits which was an interesting exsperience
